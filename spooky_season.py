## Woburn Challenge 2016-17 Round 1 - Junior Division
"""
Late October can be a rather frightening time of year. Night begins to 
fall ever earlier, ancient Pagan rituals make demons stir, and at the
 end of the month, hordes of small creatures can even be seen roaming 
 the streets! It's a spooky sight if there ever was one.

But just how spooky is this demonic festival? Its spookiness level 
can, in fact, be measured and represented as a single integer S(2 <= S <=20). 
However, a simple number doesn't truly do the spooky sensation 
justice. As such, it can also be described with the word spoo...ooky, 
with exactly S o's.

Given the integer , can you cast a spooky incantation on your 
computer to have it produce the corresponding spooky word?
