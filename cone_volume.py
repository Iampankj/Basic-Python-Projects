## The Challenge
## Calculate the volume of a right circular cone.

## Input
## The input consists of two lines of text. The first line contains integer r, the
## radius of the cone. The second line contains integer h, the height of the
## cone. Both r and h are between 1 and 100. (That is, the minimum value for r
## and h is 1, and the maximum value is 100.)

## Output
## Output the volume of the right circular cone with radius r and height h. The
## formula to calculate the volume is (Ï€*r^2*h)/3.

PI = 3.141592653589793
radius = int(input())
height = int(input())
volume = (PI*radius**2*height)/3
print(volume)
